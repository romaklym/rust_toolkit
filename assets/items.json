If loaded with Incendiary Rockets, the Rocket Launcher may be used as an area denial tool to spread fire to an area to prevent movement through it. Regular rockets or High Velocity Rockets may also be used as an efficient, but expensive, weapon to be used against players, as its high damage usually means an instant kill.",

Furthermore, shots should only be made with it if it's likely that the majority of the pellets in a blast will connect with their target. It makes for a strong early game weapon because of its relatively low cost. If the extra resources are available, it's a much safer and more reliable investment than the Waterpipe Shotgun since it's not as dependent on a single shot killing an enemy.
